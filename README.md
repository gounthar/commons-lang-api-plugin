commons-lang-api Plugin
===================

This plugin provides [Commons Lang v2.x](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-lang/) to Jenkins Plugins.<br>

Version will be "<commons-lang version>_<plugin version>", so clear what upstream dependency it is offering and plugin can be patch by "plugin version" if required.

### Change Log

#### Version 2.6_0 (Feb TBC, 2022)
